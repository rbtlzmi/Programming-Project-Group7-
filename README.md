## Banker's Algorithm

The program reads the information from a file. The file contains the number of processes, the number of resource types, the number of resources of each type in existence, the current allocation matrix (first row, followed by the second row, and so on), and the request matrix (first row, followed by the second row, and so on).

__Sample input file__

``` 
10 5 7
7 5 3
3 2 2
9 0 2
2 2 2
4 3 3
0 1 0
2 0 0
3 0 2
2 1 1
0 0 2
```

All fields on a line are separated by whitespace.

The first line of the input file contains two integers, the number of processes and the number of resource types. The next line contains the total number of resources of each type. The next lines contain the data for the current allocation matrix (first row, followed by the second row, and so on). There must be one line for each process in this matrix. The final set of lines contain the data for the request matrix. Again, there must be one line for each process.
